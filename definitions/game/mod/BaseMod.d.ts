     * 3. If the registration contains a `description` field, sets the `mod` property in the description to this mod's `ModInformation`.
     * 4. If the registration is not "basic", IE: it needs to do something besides allocate an enum, it will have an entry in a switch
     * block for its `registration.type`. If it doesn't, by default it just allocates the enum using `registrationTypeToEnumMap`.
