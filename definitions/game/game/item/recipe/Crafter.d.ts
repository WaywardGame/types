     *
     * ### What is this for?
     *
     * A single input could be used for more than one thing in a recipe. Consider the following example:
     *
     * 1. We have a recipe that takes any rock item, and an item from the "sharpened" group.
     * 2. We have only one sharpened rock and one large rock in our inventory.
     * 3. The recipe requirements are iterated through:
     * 	- For the "any rock item" requirement, the first item that matches is "used". In this case, it's the "sharpened rock".
     * 	- For the "sharpened group" requirement, the only remaining item is the large rock, so it doesn't match.
     * 		- Since there were no items that matched the sharpened group, it looks back to the items already "used", and tries
     * to "free" those items. **That's this function**.
     * 		- Freeing an item means returning back to the requirement that used it, and checking if any other items will
     * fit the requirement.
     * 		- If any other items matched that item, this method returns true, and then the item can be used by the
     * requirement that needed it to be freed.
     * 		- In this example, the large rock also fits the "any rock item" requirement, so the sharpened rock is freed
     * for use by the "sharpened group" requirement.
